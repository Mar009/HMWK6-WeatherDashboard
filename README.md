  3- an img icon that reflects the weather conditions
  4- current temperature in F
  5 - Humidity in %
  6- Uv index: which will display with color indicators of the type of conditions, favorable, moderate, or severe
The future forecast (5- days) would show:

The site would also store previous locations on the side so the user can click on them again & repopulate the weather data with that select city
WHen the user opens the dashboard again, the previous city's forecast is shown.
